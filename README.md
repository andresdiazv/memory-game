To run the code, you will need to have a text editor such as vscode, a web browser, and a live server extension installed in vscode. Once you have these tools, you can open the HTML file in vscode and run the live server to view the webpage in your browser.

The CSS and JavaScript files should be linked to the HTML file for the webpage to function properly. The CSS file is linked using the link tag in the <head> section of the HTML file and the JavaScript file is linked using the script tag in the body section of the HTML file.

In summary this is a simple Memory game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
